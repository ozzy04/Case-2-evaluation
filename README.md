General description:
This program is a participant-country matching system designed to simulate the assignment of medical professionals (participants) to countries as part of a global humanitarian program, such as Doctors Without Borders. The objective is to efficiently match doctors to countries based on their language fluency and medical specialization, ensuring they can effectively meet the healthcare needs of the destination.

Program Approaches:
1. Structured Programming
Description: The program follows a clear, top-down structure where tasks are divided into functions. Each function performs a specific operation, such as input handling, matching, or displaying results.
Benefits: Improves readability and maintainability.
Allows easier debugging and testing.
2.Randomization
Description: Random numbers are used to assign participants to countries, simulating real-world unpredictability in assignments.
Benefits: Adds diversity to match results, enabling simulation of multiple scenarios
